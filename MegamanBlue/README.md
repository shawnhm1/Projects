TCSS 491 - Blue Two
==========================
Things to do:
-----------------------
## **MAP (SHAWN)**
1. Fix the random frame freezing when in the middle of the map 
  1. The ability to move once we click left and right rapidly 
2. Lock the screen when at the end of the map 
3. Walking through platforms 

## **ENEMIES (RICHARD)**
1. 2 Dumb Enemies
  1. 1 who crawls and does damage with contact 
  2. 1 who flys and does damage with contact 
3. 1 Boss 

## **MEGAMAN**
1. A way to display Health (Richard) 
2. Jump and shoot animation (Shawn) 
3. No shooting while crawling (Shawn) 
4. While rolling needs to come out of roll and jump when space is triggered (Shawn) 
5. When he takes damage he needs to flicker and become invincible (Richard) 




DONE: 
------------------------
* Create new map with no up/down scrolling.
* Fix scrolling when near edges - player now moves when near edge.
* Added basic platforms for the new map.s
* Add in platforms for the ceiling so Megaman can't jump above ceiling.
* Also add spikes and pits for new map (including logic for damage/death/temporary invincibibility and maybe launch when hitting spikes)
* Change the shooting code to set one delay instead of ongoing interval for shooting cooldown.
